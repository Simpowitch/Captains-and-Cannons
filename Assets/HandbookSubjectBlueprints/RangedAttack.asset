  subjectTitle: ' Ranged Attack'
  subjectDescription: 'Ranged attacks are performed by selecting a valid character(Captains,
    chefs and gunners ) with a ranged action.


    Click the red ranged icon in
    the actionbar to prepare the action.

    Ranged attacks have no range limit
    but are generally weaker than melee attacks.


    Once a ranged action is prepared
    right click an enemy target to perform the attack.


    This action will cost
    all remaining actions points on the selected character.'
