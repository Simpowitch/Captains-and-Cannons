  eventDescription: "You find a cave on the island, but as you walk inside the exit
    is closed shut. It's dark, except from inside the cave, you spot an orange glow,
    you walk close to it. As you walk closer you hear a whisper. \u201CA sacrifice\u201D.
    Some skeletons suddenly appear and surround you. You're either gonna have to
    make a sacrifice or fight your way out of here."
