    backstory: Having weak kneecaps is generally not a positive physical trait for
      the likes of pirates. This is the consequence that Corrin was forced to deal
      with after he got both his kneecaps blown off in a cannonball related incident.
      He has developed a jealousy of people who have particularly strong kneecaps,
      as he perceives this to be a strong feature for masculine men to have. To compensate,
      he has been aiming to improve his upper body strength to become a fierce duelist.
