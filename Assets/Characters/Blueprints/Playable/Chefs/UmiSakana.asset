    backstory: Umi Sakana was told at an early age that women should cook, and so
      she was forced into learning it. But she would not be forced anymore, she left
      for the sea to prove that she was not bound to what others told her. If she
      was to cook she would do it her own way, cooking at sea for the fiercest pirates
      there were.
