    backstory: "Johnny always had a habit of taking things too literally. In his
      early days he was often complimented by his own mother to have such bright
      and good looking teeth, but facing himself within his own reflection proved
      to be quite unsatisfying. Having normal, white teeth was no satisfaction for
      a man of his caliber, which would result in him getting golden teeth from a
      mysterious salesman. However these teeth turned out to have a strange effect,
      as it would prove to have the ability to bring great fortune to his surroundings.\r
      This has allowed him to gain the reputation that he currently beholds, making
      him one of the most famous pirates of all time."
