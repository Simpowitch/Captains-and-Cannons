    backstory: Cecilia Wasa did not see the world as others did, ruled by men, they
      were all fools. Cecilia Wasa was not to be ordered around. Everytime she got
      sent out on missions in the word of the king, she always made sure to go off
      road to recruit people to her crew. She intended to only have the best of the
      best from all over the world. When her crew got big enough she would leave
      the mainland to be her own woman and rule the way she saw fit at sea.
