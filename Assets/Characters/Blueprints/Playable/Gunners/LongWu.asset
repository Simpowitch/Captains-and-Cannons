    backstory: "L\xF3ng W\xFA lives every day like it's his last, he is not afraid
      of death. In fact he believes he has conquered it. This is why he does what
      no sane person would do: he uses fireworks as his weapons, he does it for the
      game of chance that it provides. It's just as likely that it will backfire
      as it will kill his opponent."
